# testApp1

This small project provides a Python CLI and a simple React web page to
invoke the WorkflowAI API that generates a SWOT analysis for a given
company name.

## React interface

Open `index.html` in a browser. Enter a company name and submit the form
to call the API. The JSON response is displayed on the page.

## Python CLI

Run the CLI with `python swot_interface.py` and follow the prompt to
enter the company name. The script prints the JSON response.
